Hacking Tool - Adding Hidden Admin Account on Windows Machine

This tool is designed to add a hidden administrator account to a Windows machine, which can be used for malicious purposes. It does this by exploiting the sticky keys feature, which allows for a command prompt to be opened with administrative privileges, even from the lock screen.
Operating Instructions

    Obtain a Windows machine that you have permission to hack. This tool should not be used to hack machines without permission, as it is illegal.
    Download the tool onto a USB drive. You can do this by downloading the tool and copying it onto the USB drive, or by cloning the tool's repository onto the USB drive.
    Insert the USB drive into the Windows machine you want to hack.
    Reboot the Windows machine, and press the appropriate key to enter the BIOS menu (this is usually F2 or DEL).
    Change the boot order so that the USB drive is the first boot device.
    Save and exit the BIOS menu.
    Wait for the Windows machine to boot from the USB drive.
    The tool should automatically run, and the sticky keys feature should be exploited to open a command prompt with administrative privileges.
    The tool will then add a hidden administrator account to the Windows machine, and display a success message.
    The tool will then exit.
    Remove the USB drive from the Windows machine.
    Reboot the Windows machine.
    Wait for the Windows machine to boot normally.
    Press the Windows key + X, and select "Computer Management" from the menu that appears.
    In the Computer Management window, expand "Local Users and Groups" and select "Users".
    The hidden administrator account should be listed here. Double-click on it to edit its properties.
    You can now use this account to log in to the Windows machine and perform malicious actions.
